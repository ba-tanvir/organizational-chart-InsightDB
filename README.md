Color of each subtree is different for understanding the graph from a distance. 

# Technologies Used
--> Angularjs (16)
--> PrimeNg (Graph renderer)
--> PrimeFace (Modifying the style of the graph)
--> html2Canvas && downloadjs (for downloading the graph)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
